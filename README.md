# Elemental Framework for Blazor

Elemental is a series of high level components designed to speed up Blazor projects.

Visit our [demo site](https://elemental-docs-app.azurewebsites.net/) for a live demo of all components and code details.

## Styled Buttons

Elemental styled buttons come with a built-in property for dark/light theme.

## Dropdown

NB! AeDropdown is for single select only, old multi-select dropdowns should be replaced with AeSelect

Elemental dropdown binds to a property a list of objects in a single component.

## Model Form

The Model Form is attempt to streamline forms using annotations. Standard C# annotations such as Required, StringLength and Range will be passed to the form for validation and one single component will bind each public property of the model to Blazor form components.

```html
<ModelForm Model="@_starship" OnValidSubmit="HandleValidSubmit"/>
```

will render into:
